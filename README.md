# Fitness_Booking



The Fitness Class Booking API is a backend system for a fictional fitness studio. It allows clients to view available fitness classes (like Yoga, Zumba, HIIT) and book a spot in their preferred class. The project is developed using Django and Django REST Framework, with SQLite as the database.

This API is designed with simplicity and clarity, ideal for beginner to intermediate-level developers or companies looking for a basic online booking.
